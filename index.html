      <h2>Hi, I'm Rachel Navarro.</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently a junior at the 
        <a href="https://uci.edu/">University of California, Irvine</a>
        (class of '22!), where I'm studying computer science with a specialization in intelligent systems.
        During the summer of 2020, I interned with the Geo team at  
        <a href="https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/step/">Google</a> as 
        part of the Student Training in Engineering Program (STEP), formerly known as the Engineering Practicum. 
        At UCI, I'm involved in 
        <a href="https://wics.ics.uci.edu/">Women in Information and Computer Sciences</a>, the
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/swe.uci//">Society of Women Engineers</a>, the 
        <a href="https://www.fadauci.net/">Film-Arts-Drama Alliance</a>, and the 
        <a href="https://honors.uci.edu/">Campuswide Honors Collegium</a>. 
        My interests include machine learning, artificial intelligence, big data, slam poetry, human-computer interaction, 
        filmmaking, technical direction, skateboarding, product management/design, and everything in-between.
      </p>
      <p> 
        I've always had an affinity for utilizing my creativity to build new things. I'm very curious about technology and the ways in which it 
        can be used to fix, connect, and ultimately improve our world. I am also passionate about closing the gender gap in technology and 
        providing mentorship and support to other womxn in computer science. Feel free to say hello via <a href="mailto:rtnavarro737@gmail.com">email</a>, 
        or connect with me on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/rachel-navarro-922b70191">Linkedin</a> or <a href="https://github.com/rtnavarr">Github</a>!
