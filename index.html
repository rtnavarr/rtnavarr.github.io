      <h2>Hi, I'm Rachel Navarro.</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently a junior at the 
        <a class="link" href="https://uci.edu/"><span class="wavy">University of California, Irvine</span></a>
        (class of '22!), where I'm studying
        computer science with a specialization in intelligent systems. I interned at <a href="https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/step/">Google</a> as 
        part of the Student Training in Engineering (STEP, formerly known as the Engineering Practicum) program, on the Geo team during summer 2020. Some of my
        interests include machine learning, big data, human-computer interaction, filmmaking, and product management/design.
      </p>

      <p> 
        I've always had an affinity for utilizing my creativity to build new things. I'm very curious about technology and the ways in which it 
        can be used to fix, connect, and ultimately improve our world. I am also passionate about closing the gender gap in technology and 
        providing mentorship and support for other womxn in computer science. Feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:rtnavarro737@gmail.com">email</a>, 
        or connect with me on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/rachel-navarro-922b70191">Linkedin</a> or <a href="https://github.com/rtnavarr">Github</a>!
